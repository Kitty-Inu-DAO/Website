Last I heard, they were seen heading south for the winter, sipping pi√±a coladas on some sun-soaked server far, far away. Now, aren't they living the life? Meanwhile, we're stuck here, navigating the vast abyss of the web. Maybe if we're quiet enough, we'll lure the page back. Until then, why not try searching again or visiting another page? And remember, not all URLs are heartbreakers!</p>
