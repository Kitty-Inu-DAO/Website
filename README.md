### :bullettrain_side: Architecture

Inform the nextjs page that the component is a Threejs component. For that, simply add the **r3f** property to the parent component.

```jsx
const Page = (props) => {
  return (
    <>
      <div>Hello !</div>
    </>
  )
}
// canvas components goes here
// It will receive same props as Page component (from getStaticProps, etc.)
Page.r3f = (props) => (
  <>
    <Shader />
  </>
)

export default Page
```
