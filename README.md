Inform the nextjs page that the component is a Threejs component. For that, simply add the **r3f** property to the parent component.

```jsx
const Page = (props) => {
  return (
    <>
      <div>Hello !</div>
    </>
  )
}
// canvas components goes here
// It will receive same props as Page component (from getStaticProps, etc.)
Page.r3f = (props) => (
  <>
    <Shader />
  </>
)

export default Page
```

## Contributing 

- All contributions should be made as a pull request to the `dev` branch. Pull requests to `main` will be ignored. 

- PRs must include a concise but descriptive title of the feature, bug, chore, etc. the PR is addressing.

## Deployment

- This repository uses Fleek for deployments of the `main` branch to IFPS. 
- ENS is used as the domain.

### Browsers with ENS support 

Production deployment at: <https://kitty-inu-dao.eth/>

### All Other Browsers:

#### Cloudflare with .link

Production deployment at: <https://kitty-inu-dao.eth.link/>

Centralized way to access information in the ENS from DNS, managed by Cloudflare.

#### Preferred: Wildcarded DNS Record

Production deployment at: <https://kitty-inu-dao.eth.limo/>

Decentralized alternative to eth.link. Similar to eth.link, eth.limo is based on a wildcarded DNS record, *.eth.limo. However, instead of being managed by a single organization, it is powered by a DAO.
